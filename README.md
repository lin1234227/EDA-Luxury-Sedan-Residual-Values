# Residual values of luxury sedans
I analysed 88,211 sedans traded on cars.com. The included brands are the most representative six luxury brands among the U.S.

<b>Do German brands depreciate faster than the Japanese?<b>

LIA(Lexus, Infinity, Acura) are the widely perceived Japanese luxury auto brands and ABB(Audi, BMW, Benz) are for German. A residual ratio is calculated for them:

Below graph shows the changing residual ratio with the year of use:

ABB has surpassed LIA in the preliminary years of use, but its market value falls more quickly in the next whole decade. Until around 12 years after the purchase, the two curves meet each other. The next question is what factors are influencing the residual ratio. I looked into the type of transmission(automatic, manual, auto w/ manual), the difference in the drivetrain(front-wheel, all-wheel, rear-wheel drive), the engine size and the model segments(D, E, F-segment). Here are the findings:

According to figures above, a lower-end, small-capacity vehical will likely depreciate less. If within the 3rd-year-to-10th-year time frame, a car having its front wheels as the dirving wheel would be more valuable. Moreover, from figure 2, cars with automatic gearbox are likely priced higher than those with manuals.

<b>Does your state demand the most luxury cars per person?</b>

The number of traded used vehicles reflects the potential demand for them. Following graph addresses how likely people in each state needs a LIA or ABB sedan.<br/>

<br/>The color is drawn based on the number of vehicles being traded per capital in that state. The darker the blue is, the more dynamic market there is. Here is another graph showing the median household income by the state in 2014. Anything related? I think so.<br/>

<b>What are the most popular exterior and interior colors for luxury sedans?</b>

How are sellers describing the exteriors and interiors of their cars?

Then what is the most popular looking for luxury sedans? By merging multiple words describing the same color (for example, ebony, graphite, and charcoal all mean black), we get to know how popular each color is. For the exterior, the most popular color is silver, followed by black(28.5%).<br/>

<br/>For the interior, the black interior has the dominate share.
